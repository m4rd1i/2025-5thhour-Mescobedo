#1. Create a for loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 1 and then prints "Hello World!"
#at the end.
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Hello World!")

#2. Create a for loop that counts up and prints only even numbers between 1 and 30.
for m in range(1, 31):
    if m % 2 == 0:
        print(m)

#3. Create a for loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the number is
#divisible by 3.
for a in range(1, 31, 2):
    if a % 3 == 0:
        continue
    else:
        print(a)

#4. Create a for loop that prints 5 different animals from a list.
animals = ["Cat", "Dog", "Mouse", "Donkey", "Bunny"]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal)
#5. Create a for loop that spells out a word you input backwards.
#(HINT: Google "How to reverse a string in Python")
for d in input ("Reverse the string: ")[::-1]:
    print(d)

#6. Create a list containing 10 integers of your choice and print the list.
numList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(numList)

#7. Create two empty variables named evenNumbers and oddNumbers.
evenNumb=0
oddNum=0
#8. Make a loop that counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list, and prints the
#result after the loop.
for w in numList:
    if w % 2 == 0:
        evenNumb += 1
    else:
        oddNum += 1
print(evenNumb,oddNum)

#9. Create a variable that asks the user for an integer and an empty integer variable.
r = int(input("Give me a number: "))
k = 1
#10. Create a loop with a range from 1 to the number the user input. Use the loop to find the
#factorial of that number and print the result. A factorial of a number is that number multiplied
#by every number before it until you reach 1. (For example: 5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
for q in range(1, r + 1):
    k*=q
print(k)
